= The Examples

To understand the code, better starting off knowing how to use the library!

.We'll therefore go on and look at the two example project shipped with the source code:
* tcp_echo
* tcp_reverse

The official documentation also extensively use them to explain the concepts.

== TCP Echo Example

Start a TCP acceptor pool that will echo anything sent to its underlying sockets.

=== ebin/tcp_echo.app

It is worth noticing here that the `ranch` dependency is part of the `applications` field, as expected.
A quick check proves that the ranch binaries are available in the `deps/` directory.

`tcp_echo_app` is the entry point of the application, as it is the
value of the `mod` parameter.

=== src/tcp_echo_app.erl

That's the entry point of the application.
The module implements the "application" API with the methods `start/2` and `stop/1` - as expected.

In `start/2`, `ranch:start_listener/5` is called. That's the core of Ranch. It starts the pool of TCP/IP listener.
Take note that the module `echo_protocol` is being passed as parameter.

The next line `tcp_echo_sup:start_link()` basically starts a custom supervisor.

Let's see the supervisor code.

=== src/tcp_echo_sup.erl

It's written as a dynamic supervisor, but...
No child is ever added using `supervisor:start_child/2` in the rest of the files.
So as is, this supervisor is useless...

=== src/echo_protocol.erl

This module was passed as parameter in `ranch:start_listener/5`.
It implements the ranch protocol behaviour (`-behaviour(ranch_protocol)`).
The entry point being `start_link/3` that basically spawn a linked process that will
ultimately run `init/3`.
Contrary to a traditional `gen_server` that's not `init/1` that's being called.

`init/3` runs `ranch:handshake(Ref)` which most probably initiates the Socket acceptors...?
Then it runs a recursive `loop` function, that simply pattern match the data being received.
`Transport:recv(Socket, 0, 5000)` being probably a blocking operation, it just waits until data is received.

Then, it reads the first data and if anything is received, echoes back the same message using `Transport:send(Socket, Data)`
and start the same function `loop` again.
Ultimately, when no data is received, it closes the socket using `Transport:close(Socket)`.
Then it goes out of the loop and the process terminates.


=== What did we learn?

.Now, we know that:
* `ranch:start_listener/5` must be used by the user, and is the starting point of the TCP/IP listener pool
* as expected, `ranch_protocol` is a behaviour that people have to implement and then pass to `ranch:start_listener/5` as an argument.
* `ranch:handshake/1` must be run when initializing the Protocol, before starting the connection process

== TCP Reverse example

Start a TCP acceptor pool that will echo
the reversed version of anything sent to its underlying sockets.

=== ebin/tcp_reverse.app

Nothing much different from before here, just a basic `.app` file which tells us
that `tcp_reverse_app` is the starting module of the application.

=== src/tcp_reverse_app.erl

Starting the ranch_listener, like before.
Still using `ranch_tcp` transport, and this time the custom `reverse_protocol`.

=== src/tcp_reverse_sup.erl

Same as before. Useless supervisor here.

=== src/reverse_protocol.erl

This example is useful to show how to integrate a `gen_statem` custom protocol handler
with Ranch.
It would also work the same way for a `gen_server`.

The https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/ranch/1.7/guide/protocols/#_using_gen_statem[official Ranch documentation]
is enough.

Read https://learnyousomeerlang.com/finite-state-machines[LYSEFGG] and

to know more about Finite State Machines and gen_statem.

== Summary

We can now already make a schema summarizing how the different notions integrate together,
based on the examples and the documentation.

.A few things to notice here:
* the "supervising" and "monitoring" part here are to be understood in a very high-level way.
We are not yet talking about how it actually works _under the hood_ in terms of
supervision tree between the modules. Still, it helps creating a mental image
of the Ranch architecture.
* the steps related to the Acceptor are also simplified and will be discussed further later
