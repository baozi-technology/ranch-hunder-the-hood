= Diving into Ranch Source code

.We'll follow these two distinct paths to study the code:
* what happens when the library is loaded?
* what happens when the user call `ranch:start_listener/5`?

== What happens when the library is loaded?

include::when_library_loaded.adoc[]


== What happens when the user call `ranch:start_listener/5`?

include::on_start_listener.adoc[]

== Summary

include::summary_server_listener.adoc[]


== The other files

include::other_files.adoc[]
