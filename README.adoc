= Ranch: what's under the hood?

This document is a summary of my analysis of https://github.com/ninenines/ranch[Ranch] 2.0.0-rc.1 source code, performed in August 2019.
It has been done purely in an old-school manual way, cloning the project from github and going through it.

By helping understand the intricacy of a well-established but somewhat small Erlang library,
the reader can:

* improve its Erlang proficiency
* be able to help maintaining Ranch
* be able to reuse Ranch codebase or get inspired by it for other projects

WARNING: This analysis has been performed while I just started learning Erlang,
right after going through https://learnyousomeerlang.com/[Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good].
As a consequence, there may be some errors. Feedbacks are welcome! *WORK IN PROGRESS*
